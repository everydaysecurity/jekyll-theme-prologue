Do not use public Wi-Fi that don’t have passwords.
Before we connect to Wi-Fi, make sure we ask employee what actual Wi-Fi is.
Do not log into important account, especially bank account.
Use VPN (Virtual Private Network) to make sure data got encrypted.
Use only “https” website, instead of just “http” sites.
Turn off file sharing system.
Turn off auto-connect to Wi-Fi.
Log out of any opened account.
